# Getting Started with React.js & VS Code

## Disclaimer

This presentation is intended only to get you started. It should not be considered a list of best practices for React development. It is just a collection of TIL moments from the perspective of a .Net developer with limited web development. There may be better ways of doing things. If you see areas for improvement or find errors, please share them.

Please note, some of these projects include intentional errors (to help our discussion).

## Installing packages for all projects

You can install all the packages for all the projects up front, saving you time in the future. To do so, from this directory:

```
npm i
npm run install-all
```

This task will take a long time to complete, so you might consider installing packages for individual projects as needed.

## Installing packages for individual projects

You can install the packages for an individual project. To do so, change into the individual project directory:

```
npm i
```

## Running the code

See the respective `README.md` for each project.

## Getting Started

[Learning Resources](./docs/learning.md)

[Set Up](./docs/setup-dev.md)

[Basics](./docs/basics.md)

* Routing
* Redux

## Our Goal

We are going to create a working React application that simulates a simple blog. Mockups of the app in the [docs](./docs/mockups) folder.

The app will not be production ready, but hopefully will illustrate how many of the moving parts fit together.

## Sample Projects

* react-basics
* react-router
* redux-counter
* static-site (aka - HOT MESS!!!)
* client-server
